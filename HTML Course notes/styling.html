      What is Lorem Ipsum ?
    </h1>
    <p style="color: red;">
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing <br>
      and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's<br> 
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer<br> 
      took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen <br>
      <hr>
      book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap <br>
      into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It <br>
      was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <br>
      containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop <br>
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <br>
      Lorem Ipsum.

      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
